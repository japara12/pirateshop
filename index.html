                    <h3>Blackbeard</h3>
                    <p>Most of what we know about the Blackbeard and his fellow pirates come from one source, . The text covers in great detail his plundering, murdering exploits and turns up some fascinating facts about the most notorious pirate to sail the seven seas.</p>

                    <h3>Capitan Jack Sparrow</h3>
                    <p>Jack Sparrow was a legendary pirate of the Seven Seas, and the irreverent trickster of the Caribbean. A captain of equally dubious morality and sobriety, a master of self-promotion and self-interest, Jack fought a constant and losing battle with his own best tendencies. Whether by cause or accident, he was the quickest to seize the moment and make it his own. Captain Jack's first love was the sea, his second, his beloved ship the Black Pearl.</p>

                    <h3>Hook</h3>
                    <p>In the animated film Peter Pan, Hook is a far more comical villain than the original character: he is seen as a vain coward with a childish temper who is prone to crying out in terror. During the film's early development, the story department analysed Hook's character as "a fop... Yet very mean, to the point of being murderous. This combination of traits should cause plenty of amusement whenever he talks or acts"</p>

                    <h3>Burger Beard</h3>
                    <p>The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water" is the second SpongeBob SquarePants movie and definitely the trippiest. The film blends live-action with animation and straight storytelling with meta-narrative into one hallucinogenic fever dream of a film. "Sponge Out of Water" starts when a pirate named Burger Beard narrates an adventure of SpongeBob's (Tom Kenny) as Plankton (Mr. Lawrence) once again tries to steal the Krabby Patty formula (which, if some "SpongeBob" fan theories are true, he may really not want).</p>
